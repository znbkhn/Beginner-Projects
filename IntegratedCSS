  <h2 class="destination">1. Gibraltar </h2>
   <div class="description"> An overseas British territory, I first learnt about its existence when I met one of my best friends in University who happened to be from there. 5 years later, we finally made it there with perfect timing (the first national lockdown was announced a month later). It's a very small place, we managed to do the entire strait <strong>AND</strong> cross the Spanish border in one day!

   The weather was incredible, the perfect balance of warm and breezy (which if you're British you know is rare). Its relatively inexpensive as well which is always great.
