  <h2 class="destination">1. Gibraltar </h2>
   <div class="description"> An overseas British territory, I first learnt about its existence when I met one of my best friends in University who happened to be from there. 5 years later, we finally made it there with perfect timing (the first national lockdown was announced a month later). It's a very small place, we managed to do the entire strait <strong>AND</strong> cross the Spanish border in one day!
   <br>
   The weather was incredible, the perfect balance of warm and breezy (which if you're British you know is rare). Its relatively inexpensive as well which is always great.

<h2 class="destination">2. Karachi </h2>
 <div class="description"> I last visited in February for a week. I quickly realised this was the perfect length of time to spend in Pakistan because there is zero chance you'll end up in unnecessary family drama. 
 <br>
 In & out, super quick- just how it should be. The weather was great too, a welcome change since we always go in August at the height of Monsoon season-February was much more mild and breezy.

   <h2 class="destination">3. Rome </h2>
<div class="description"> I visited Rome the day my Master's began (great timing right?) with my two best friends from undergrad and while Rome itself was a bit of a shithole, the experience of being with my friends was one I really enjoyed.
<br>
  So British of me I know but I was so excited to visit Sephora, I ended up getting a blush which I admittedly will probably never finish but at least I have it. Consumerism wins again...
